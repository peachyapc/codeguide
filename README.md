*Create Descriptive Names* By Diomidis Spinellis. [Link](

###Examples
###1.Commenting and Documentation 
>*A bold comment at the beginning of each file.*

```
package work;

import java.util.NoSuchElementException;
import java.util.ArrayList;

/**
 * The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out stack of objects. 
 * @author  Joseph Bergin
 * @version 1.0, May 2000
 * Note that this version is not thread safe. 
 */
 public class Stack {...}
 ```

>*Comment every important variable name*

```
//  position x,y of the graph
private double pointX, pointY;
```


>*Comment each method with a description of what it does, its parameters, and what it returns, as well as possible errors and exceptions.*


```
/**
* Returns the object at the top of this stack without removing it. 
* @return  the object at the top of this stack. 
* @exception  NoSuchElementException  if this stack is empty.
*/
public Object peek() throws NoSuchElementException{
    int length = this.elements.size();
    if (length == 0) throw new NoSuchElementException();
    return this.elements.get(length - 1);
}
```

###2.Whitespace.

>*Use blank lines to separate your code into logical sections.*

```for(int i=0;i<n;i++)    vs.      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)```

>*Don't put more than one statement on a line.*

```
Bad example
if(j<5){System.out.print(j);}
```

```
Good example
if (j < 5) {
    System.out.print(j);
}
```

>*Use spaces to align parallel code whenever it enhances readability.*

>*Do not put spaces before a semicolon.*




###3.Create Descriptive Names.
>*Use meaningful names that convey the purpose of the variable.*

>*Variables : A short, but meaningful*

```isPrime, mass```

>*Constant : Use all capital letters and separate internal words with the underscore character.*

```MAX_HEIGHT, CONSTANT_CURRENCY```

>*Class : A noun that communicates what the class represents.*

```class Complex, class PhoneNumber```

>*Method : A verb that communicates what the method does.*

```move (), draw (), isDrive()```


###4.Avoid returning anonymous or inner classes
>*They keep a reference to the outer instance.And they will drag that outer instance to wherevery they go, e.g. to some scope outside of your local class if youâ€™re not careful. This can be a major source for memory leaks, as your whole object graph will suddenly entangle in subtle ways.*

>The Rule: Whenever you write an anonymous, local or inner class, 
check if you can make it static or even a regular top-level class. Avoid returning anonymous, local or inner class instances from methods to the outside scope.


```
Avoid doing this

Collections.sort(money, new Comparator<Valuable>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(Valuable o1, Valuable o2) {
	return o1.getCurrency().compareTo(o2.getCurrency());
    }			
});
```
